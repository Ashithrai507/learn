# What is a Data Structure?

### A Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

A cupboard is a data structure — it helps you store and organize your clothes.

If your clothes are scattered, finding your favorite t-shirt will take time.

But if your cupboard (data structure) is organized — shirts in one place, pants in another — you can find things fast!

## Why are Data Structures Important?

Because every real-world program — from databases to games to AI models — relies on data.
How efficiently you store, access, and modify that data determines how fast and optimized your program will be.

A list of names can be stored in an array.

If you want to search quickly among millions of names, use a hash table or binary search tree.

If you want to manage tasks (like undo/redo), use a stack.

For handling queues (like print jobs or requests), use a queue.

## linear Data Structures

| Type            | Description                                           | Example Use               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Array**       | Stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory | List of marks             |
| **Linked List** | Each element (node) has data + pointer to next        | Dynamic memory usage      |
| **Stack**       | LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure                   | Undo/Redo, Function calls |
| **Queue**       | FIFO (First In, First Out) structure                  | Task scheduling           |

## Non-Linear Data Structures

| Type      | Description                                      | Example Use                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Tree**  | Hierarchical structure with root and child nodes | File systems, XML/HTML parsing     |
| **Graph** | Set of connected nodes (vertices) and edges      | Maps, networks, social connections |

## Hash-based Structures

| Type                      | Description                      | Example Use        |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Hash Table / Hash Map** | Key-value pairs for quick lookup | Databases, caching |
